# Quantifying the effects of different data streams on the calibration of building energy simulation

## Introduction
This repository presents the documents and the code employed in our latest work *"Quantifying the effects of different data streams on the calibration of building energy simulation"*. This study investigates and quantifies the impacts of inputs and outputs on Bayesian calibration performance of building energy modelling. The research incorporates both single-output and multiple-output Bayesian calibration.

More details can be found in [our paper](https://to_be_added ):
