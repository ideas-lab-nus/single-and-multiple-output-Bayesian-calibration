# Quantifying the effects of different data streams on the calibration of building energy simulation

## Introduction
This repository presents the documents and the code employed in our latest work "Quantifying the effects of different data streams on the calibration of building energy simulation". This study investigates and quantifies the impacts of inputs and outputs on Bayesian calibration performance of building energy modelling. The research incorporates both single-output and multiple-output Bayesian calibration.
